This repository contains snippets of code and some R Markdown tutorials that demonstrate how you can use R and Github in volcanology and tephra studies.

** DISCLAIMER ** This repository is very much a work in progress and is incomplete at the time of the vVMSG2022 conference (Jan 2022). Please save this [ðŸ”—linkðŸ”—](https://github.com/HannahBuckland/vVMSG2022) and keep checking back for new updates. If you are a GitHub user you can turn on notifications for repository updates.

The code and examples I have shared will require some basic knowledge of R.
However, if it would be useful in the future I could put together some more beginner levels tutorials, so if is something you would be interested in please do get in contact with me.
In the mean time, there is already a lot of help and guidance out there. 
An excellent place to start is to follow these guidelines: [Getting-Started-with-R](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201141096-Getting-Started-with-R).

Ideally, to use the resources I am sharing here you will have [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed on your computer.
It would also help to have a [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) account which you then can integrate with [RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). Linking up GitHub and RStudio makes life so much easier but can be a bit of a faff especially with university managed computers (various SSH keys etc.) but again because of the broad usership, there is so much help [available online](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/) for getting this setup on your workstation. If in doubt Google your question/problem/error someone will have had the same issue :)


# Repository Contents

## [R Markdown Tutorials](https://github.com/HannahBuckland/vVMSG2022/tree/main/docs)
In this section you will find R Markdown documents each with a different theme. [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) is way to write dynamic documents in which you can embed code chunks and dynamically read in new data. They can be used similarly to a [Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) where the user can go through the document and edit the code chunks as they wish.

## [Code folder](https://github.com/HannahBuckland/vVMSG2022/tree/main/code)
In this folder you can find miscellaneous scripts. Some contain functions that I have written that you can call into multiple documents. Others are standalone scripts that will read in the data and process it all in one.

## [Data visualisations](https://github.com/HannahBuckland/vVMSG2022/blob/main/plots)
In this repository I will include a number of scripts to produce data visualisations ranging from maps to fun visualisations of Netflix titles.

Again, just to stress this repository is a very much work a **in progress**. It would be great to gauge if there is much interest in me sharing these resources so I don't spend to much time preparing things that nobody is using. 

Thanks everyone!
